**Version:** 1.3
**Date:** 08/27/2025

**Note on the Level of Detail:** This document provides an overview of the backend specifications. Each section can be further elaborated and detailed in subsequent documents or stages (e.g., detailed API specifications, complete database schema).

**1. Objective**

This document describes the technical and functional specifications of the backend for the "Vintage Without Borders" e-commerce site for wine barrels. The backend will be responsible for data management, business logic, authentication, and exposing the necessary APIs for the frontend to operate.

**2. Key Technologies**

*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **Web API Framework:** FastAPI
    *   *Advantages:* High performance, automatic data validation (Pydantic), interactive documentation (Swagger UI/ReDoc).
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (recommended for its robustness and advanced features)
    *   *Simple alternative for initial development:* SQLite (for quick setup)
*   **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):** SQLAlchemy (with Alembic for database migrations)
*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
*   **Containerization:** Docker (for easier deployment and management)

**3. Main Backend Responsibilities**

The backend will manage the following functionalities via RESTful APIs:

*   **Product Management (Barrels):**
    *   Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) for barrels.
    *   Inventory management (available quantities, status).
    *   Search and filtering of barrels.
*   **User Management:**
    *   User registration and login (B2C and B2B).
    *   User profile management (addresses, contact information).
    *   Role and permission management (administrator, B2B client, B2C client).
*   **Order Management:**
    *   Creation and tracking of orders.
    *   Updating order status.
    *   Order history per user.
*   **Quote Management:**
    *   Creation, tracking, and management of B2B quote requests.
    *   Generation of custom quotes.
*   **Payment Integration:**
    *   Interface with secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
    *   Management of transactions and refunds.
*   **Logistics and Shipping:**
    *   Potential integration with carrier APIs for fee calculation and tracking.
    *   Generation of shipping documents.
*   **Content Management (Lightweight CMS):**
    *   API for managing static pages (About Us, Contact, FAQ) if not handled by an external CMS.

**4. Data Model (High Level)**

*   **`Users`:** `id`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role` (`admin`, `b2b`, `b2c`), `first_name`, `last_name`, `company_name` (for B2B), `address_id`.
*   **`Addresses`:** `id`, `street`, `city`, `zip_code`, `country`.
*   **`Barrels`:** `id`, `name`, `origin_country`, `previous_content`, `volume_liters`, `wood_type`, `condition`, `price`, `stock_quantity`, `description`, `image_urls`.
*   **`Orders`:** `id`, `user_id`, `order_date`, `total_amount`, `status` (`pending`, `processing`, `shipped`, `delivered`, `cancelled`), `shipping_address_id`.
*   **`OrderItems`:** `id`, `order_id`, `barrel_id`, `quantity`, `price_at_purchase`.
*   **`Quotes`:** `id`, `user_id`, `request_date`, `status` (`pending`, `approved`, `rejected`), `requested_items` (JSON), `quoted_price`, `notes`.

**5. Security and Authentication**

*   **Authentication:** Based on JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure API access.
*   **Authorization:** Implementation of roles to control access to different resources (e.g., only administrators can create/modify barrels).
*   **Data Validation:** Use of Pydantic for automatic validation of incoming requests.
*   **Protection:** Against common attacks (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF) via FastAPI's built-in features and best practices.
*   **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data (passwords, payment information) will be encrypted at rest and in transit.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implementation of mechanisms to prevent abuse and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on API endpoints.

**6. API Design Principles**

*   **RESTful:** Use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and appropriate status codes.
*   **Clarity and Consistency:** Clear and consistent resource names.
*   **Documentation:** Automatic generation of API documentation (Swagger UI/ReDoc) to facilitate frontend integration.
*   **Error Handling:** Clear and informative error responses.
*   **API Versioning:** Use of a versioning scheme (e.g., `/v1/barrels`) to allow the API to evolve without breaking compatibility with existing clients.

**7. Deployment**

*   The backend will be containerized with Docker to ensure portability and reproducibility of the environment.
*   Deployment is planned on a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) or a VPS.

**8. Compliance and Regulation**

*   **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):** The backend will be designed in compliance with GDPR principles, including:
    *   **Data Minimization:** Collecting only necessary data.
    *   **Rights of the Data Subject:** Implementing mechanisms to allow users to exercise their rights (access, rectification, erasure, data portability).
    *   **Data Security:** Appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data.
    *   **Consent:** Management of consent for data collection and processing.
*   **Other Regulations:** Consideration of specific regulations related to international trade and the sale of alcohol-related products (if applicable to the sale of barrels).

**9. Detailed Technical Aspects**

*   **Logging and Monitoring:**
    *   Implementation of a structured logging system (e.g., JSON logs) to facilitate analysis.
    *   Definition of log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
    *   Integration with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for performance and error monitoring in production.
*   **Error Management:**
    *   Definition of custom exceptions for specific business errors.
    *   Implementation of a global error handler to standardize API error responses.
    *   Logging of critical errors.
*   **Testing Strategy:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** To validate the correct functioning of individual functions and classes.
    *   **Integration Tests:** To verify the interaction between different components (e.g., API and database).
    *   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** To simulate complete user scenarios (potentially with a testing framework like Playwright or Selenium if the frontend is integrated).
*   **Configuration Management:**
    *   Use of environment variables for sensitive configurations (API keys, database credentials).
    *   Loading configurations via libraries like `python-dotenv` or `Dynaconf`.
*   **Background Tasks:**
    *   Use of a task queue system (e.g., Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ) for long-running or asynchronous operations (sending confirmation emails, processing complex orders, generating reports).
*   **Caching:**
    *   Implementation of a caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data to improve API performance and reduce the load on the database.
*   **Reporting and Data Analysis:**
    *   **Web Analytics:** Integration with web analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) to track user behavior on the site (page views, clicks, user journeys, conversion rates).
    *   **Business Intelligence (BI) Reports:**
        *   Generation of reports from backend data (sales, inventory, customers, quotes, product performance).
        *   Ability to create custom dashboards for administrators.
        *   Exporting data for further analysis (e.g., CSV, Excel).

**10. Next Steps**

*   Detailed design of the database schema.
*   Precise definition of each API endpoint (URL, HTTP methods, parameters, responses).
*   Setup of the development environment.
